## üîç Troubleshooting

### iPhone Detection Issues

**The app now uses 8 different detection methods for Windows, but if your iPhone still isn't recognized:**

**Quick Solutions:**
- Click **"üîç Manually Select iPhone DCIM Folder"** to browse to your iPhone's photo folder
- Click **"üêõ Debug Detection"** to see exactly what the app is finding
- Use **"üß™ Test Connection"** for detailed diagnostics

**If automatic detection fails:**

**For Windows:**
- Make sure your iPhone is **unlocked** and you've tapped **"Trust This Computer"**
- Install **iTunes** or **Apple Mobile Device Support** if not already installed
- Try a **different USB port or cable** (USB 3.0 ports work best)
- **Restart both your iPhone and computer** if detection fails
- Check Windows Device Manager to see if iPhone appears under "Portable Devices"

**For macOS:**
- Make sure your iPhone is **unlocked** and you've tapped **"Trust This Computer"**
- **Close the Photos app** if it's open (it may have exclusive access)
- Install libusb with `brew install libusb` for better USB detection
- Try **disconnecting and reconnecting** your iPhone

**For Linux:**
- Make sure your iPhone is **unlocked** and you've tapped **"Trust This Computer"**
- Install required packages: `sudo apt-get install libimobiledevice-utils ifuse`
- You may need to run the app with `sudo` for the first connection
- Install libusb development package: `sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0-0-dev`

### Python Not Found

- **Use the one-click launchers** - they'll guide you to install Python
- Make sure Python is in your system PATH
- On Windows: Reinstall Python and check "Add Python to PATH"
- On macOS/Linux: Try using `python3` instead of `python`

### Permission Issues

- **Run as administrator** (Windows) or with `sudo` (macOS/Linux) if needed
- On macOS/Linux: The launchers should handle permissions automatically

### Dependency Installation Issues

- Make sure you have an **internet connection**
- Try running the launcher **as administrator**
- Check that pip is working: `python -m pip --version`
- Update pip: `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`
